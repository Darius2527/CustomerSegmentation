# CustomerSegmentation
This project demonstrates customer segmentation by using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. The goal is to group customers based on their buying behavior and identify valuable customer segments that businesses can target with specific marketing strategies.

The Project follows these steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The online retail dataset is imported and preprocessed. This involves handling missing values and formatting data correctly.

RFM Feature Engineering: RFM features (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) are calculated for each customer based on their transaction history. Recency measures the time since the last purchase, Frequency counts the number of purchases, and Monetary shows the total spending.

Outlier Handling: Outliers in the RFM features are identified and removed to make the clustering process more robust. This is done using a statistical technique called z-score analysis.

Data Standardization: The RFM features are standardized using a method called StandardScaler to bring them to a common scale. This is important for K-Means clustering.

K-Means Clustering: K-Means clustering is applied to the standardized RFM features to segment customers into distinct groups. The optimal number of clusters is determined by a technique known as the elbow method.

Cluster Analysis and Visualization: The resulting clusters are analyzed by visualizing their average RFM values using bar plots. This helps understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

Insights and Recommendations: Based on the cluster analysis, actionable insights and recommendations are provided for targeted marketing strategies to engage different customer segments effectively.

Key Libraries Used:

The project utilizes several libraries including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (for K-Means clustering and StandardScaler), seaborn, matplotlib (for visualization), and scipy (for outlier detection).

Dataset:

The project uses an online retail dataset containing customer transaction data. Similar datasets can be found on platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Conclusion:

This project offers a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering. By understanding the unique traits of each customer segment, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts for better customer engagement and retention.
